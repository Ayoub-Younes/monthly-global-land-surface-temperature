# Monthly Global Land-Surface Temperature

This project visualizes global land-surface temperature data using D3.js to create an interactive heatmap. It represents the monthly global temperatures from 1753 to 2015 with varying colors to depict temperature variations across different months and years.

## Project Overview

The heatmap visualizes the global land-surface temperatures using a color gradient, where each cell represents a month's temperature anomaly. The x-axis displays the years, and the y-axis shows the months. A color scale is used to indicate temperature ranges, with cooler temperatures shown in blue and warmer temperatures in red. A legend and tooltips provide additional information about temperature values when a user interacts with the heatmap.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Provides the structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Custom styles for layout, font, tooltip, and legend appearance.
D3.js: Utilized to create the heatmap, manage data visualization, and handle interactive elements such as tooltips and legends.
JavaScript (ES6): Handles DOM manipulation, data fetching, and the dynamic creation of visual elements.
